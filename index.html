                <p> My name is Katelynn Vengoechea. I am an aspiring web developer. I graduated from Cal State University
                of Long Beach with my Bachelor's degree in Political Science in 2016. After graduation I went on to
                pursue
                multiple positions in sales, which is how I finally ended up at my current company. I work as the HR
                manager of a small
                promotional marketing firm in San Marcos, CA. Which is also where I live with my fiance of two and a
                half years. After much soul
                searching, and a lot of thinking about my future, I've decided to pursue web development so I can one
                day start my own company.</p>
